        Choose 8 Programs for an automaton from the Program Board on the right.
        Every program can be used repeatedly. Try different program
        combinations, and observe the cost and gain of the current combination
        at the wheelâ€™s upper left board. Whenever you are satisfied with the
        combination, click Unlock to execute the Automaton. You can also reboot
        one automaton and change the program combination if it dies or you have
        a new role for it.
