        The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) were a series of conflicts fought
        between the First French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte (1804–1815) and
        a fluctuating array of European coalitions. The wars originated in
        political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789–1799) and from
        the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802) and produced a period of
        French domination over Continental Europe.
